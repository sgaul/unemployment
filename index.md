## Unemployment indicators

This section covers indicators related to unemployment and the labor force in the Hartford area. 

## Data and limitations

Data on unemployment comes from DoL and ACS. 

## What do we already know?

Unemployment rates are the single most commonly-used indicator in the reports we reviewed; below are references for some. 

### Local

## Sample results

The sample results are for all towns in Hartford and Tolland Counties since it is easier to extract ACS data that way. 

Unemployment rates from the ACS (2007 - 2011 5-year estimates)

Then get DoL data
